This is a direct JavaScript port of the mnemonic encoder originally written
in C by Oren Tirosh and available from:

https://github.com/singpolyma/mnemonicode

These routines implement a method for encoding binary data into a sequence
of words which can be spoken over the phone, for example, and converted
back to data on the other side.
