This is a direct JavaScript port of the mnemonic encoder originally written
in C by Oren Tirosh and available from:

https://github.com/singpolyma/mnemonicode

These routines implement a method for encoding binary data into a sequence
of words which can be spoken over the phone, for example, and converted
back to data on the other side.

For more information, see:

Example usage:

    >>> mn_encode([12, 36, 128, 40])
    "popcorn-adrian-exit"

    >>> mn_encode([12, 36, 128, 40], "x.x-x ")
    "popcorn.adrian-exit"

    >>> mn_decode("popcorn adrian exit")
    [12, 36, 128, 40]

Available under the MIT license.

Current status:
- mn_encode and mn_decode work and are compatible with mnemonic.c

To do:
- Automated tests
- Automatic conversion of byte arrays to/from strings or numbers
- Package as a module for use in the browser and Node.js
